# wp-file-integrity

WORK IN PROGRESS. RESULTS WILL SHOW IN PAGE HEADER, NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE.

Scans wordpress filesystem to determine any changes made to the files.

ToDo:
- ~~Add admin panel dashboard to consume reports~~
- Send email report daily
- ~~Change initial scan to happen on cron, instead of page load~~
- probably more
